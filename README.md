# DIY-Washing-Machine
components used 
1. arduino uno
2. low rpm gear motor (300-500rpm)
3. brushless Esc 40A
4. or high quality motor driver
5. 3s battery or 12 volt dc power


connect the data pins of arduino uno with respective ESC.
we can also use the relay but it only suffices for one washing mode i.e - anti clock wise and clock wise modes.
to use multiple washing modes we must use ESC or motor driver with PWM connected. 
these modes depend on RPM and timer respectively.
